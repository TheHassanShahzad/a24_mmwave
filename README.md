# Custom ROS2 Differential Drive Robot

A ROS2-based differential drive robot implementation inspired by the TurtleBot3 design. This project demonstrates how to build a custom differential drive robot from scratch, utilizing modern ROS2 tools and frameworks.

## Overview

This project provides a complete implementation of a differential drive robot, including:
- Physical robot hardware integration using micro-ROS
- Robot control using ros2_control framework
- Gazebo simulation support
- Real robot deployment capabilities

## Features

- **Hardware Interface**: Custom microROS-based firmware for real robot control
- **ROS2 Control**: Implements ros2_control for standardized robot control interfaces
- **Simulation**: Full Gazebo simulation support for testing and development
- **Navigation**: Ready-to-use navigation capabilities similar to TurtleBot3
- **Modular Design**: Easy to modify and adapt for different robot configurations

## Prerequisites

- ROS2 (Humble or newer recommended)
- Gazebo
- micro-ROS
- ros2_control packages
